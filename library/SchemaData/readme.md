# Feature: Schemadata

## Description
This feature adds schema data to your site. Schema data is a type of metadata that helps search engines understand the content of your site. This can help improve the appearance of your site in search results.
Post types can be configured to use a specific type of schema data.

## Usage
Select which Schema type should be used with each post type on the post list page for the post type in the WordPress admin area.

### Note
If no schema type is selected for a post type, the default schema type (Thing) will be used.
For more information on Schema data and the types available, see the [Schema.org website](https://schema.org/).
