/**
 * Demonstration script showing the SOLID principles improvements in the refactored Applicators
 * 
 * This script demonstrates:
 * 1. Single Responsibility Principle - Each class has one clear purpose
 * 2. Open/Closed Principle - Easy to extend without modification
 * 3. Liskov Substitution Principle - Interfaces can be substituted
 * 4. Interface Segregation Principle - Small, focused interfaces
 * 5. Dependency Inversion Principle - Depends on abstractions, not concretions

echo "=== SOLID Principles Demonstration ===\n\n";

echo "1. SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE (SRP)\n";
echo "   ✓ SignatureGenerator: Only handles signature generation\n";
echo "   ✓ CacheKeyGenerator: Only handles cache key generation\n";
echo "   ✓ CacheStorage: Only handles storage operations\n";
echo "   ✓ CacheManager: Only orchestrates cache operations\n";
echo "   ✓ RefactoredApplicatorCache: Only handles WordPress hooks\n\n";

echo "2. OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE (OCP)\n";
echo "   ✓ New cache strategies can be added without modifying existing code\n";
echo "   ✓ Interfaces allow for extension through composition\n";
echo "   ✓ Factory pattern enables easy swapping of implementations\n\n";

echo "3. LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE (LSP)\n";
echo "   ✓ Any CacheStorageInterface implementation can replace another\n";
echo "   ✓ Any SignatureGeneratorInterface implementation can replace another\n";
echo "   ✓ RefactoredApplicatorCache can replace ApplicatorCache\n\n";

echo "4. INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE (ISP)\n";
echo "   ✓ CacheKeyGeneratorInterface: Only cache key generation methods\n";
echo "   ✓ CacheStorageInterface: Only storage-related methods\n";
echo "   ✓ SignatureGeneratorInterface: Only signature-related methods\n";
echo "   ✓ CacheManagerInterface: Only high-level cache management\n\n";

echo "5. DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE (DIP)\n";
echo "   ✓ RefactoredApplicatorCache depends on CacheManagerInterface\n";
echo "   ✓ CacheManager depends on interfaces, not concrete classes\n";
echo "   ✓ CacheComponentFactory creates dependencies and injects them\n";
echo "   ✓ High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules\n\n";

echo "=== Architecture Benefits ===\n";
echo "✓ Better testability through dependency injection\n";
echo "✓ Easier maintenance with clear separation of concerns\n";
echo "✓ More flexible caching strategies\n";
echo "✓ Reduced coupling between components\n";
echo "✓ Improved code readability and understanding\n";
echo "✓ Backward compatibility maintained\n\n";

echo "=== Usage Example ===\n";
echo "// Old way (monolithic, hard to test):\n";
echo "\$cache = new ApplicatorCache(\$wpService, \$wpdb, ...\$applicators);\n\n";

echo "// New way (modular, testable, follows SOLID):\n";
echo "\$factory = new CacheComponentFactory(\$wpService, \$wpdb);\n";
echo "\$cacheManager = \$factory->createCacheManager();\n";
echo "\$cache = new RefactoredApplicatorCache(\$wpService, \$cacheManager, ...\$applicators);\n\n";

echo "The refactored implementation provides the same functionality\n";
echo "while being more maintainable, testable, and extensible.\n\n";

echo "=== Files Created ===\n";
echo "Interfaces (following ISP):\n";
foreach (glob(__DIR__ . '/Cache/*Interface.php') as $file) {
    echo "   ✓ " . basename($file) . "\n";
}

echo "\nImplementations (following SRP & DIP):\n";

        echo "   ✓ " . basename($file) . "\n";
    }
}

echo "\nRefactored Cache:\n";
echo "   ✓ RefactoredApplicatorCache.php\n";
